## LPub3D Render LDraw Models with Blender ##

A [Blender](https://www.blender.org)&trade; add-on for importing and rendering [LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org)&trade; file format models and parts.

## Purpose ##
*LPub3D Import LDraw* imports [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/)® models into Blender. This addon is intended to support direct Blender integration with [LPub3D](https://trevorsandy.github.io/lpub3d).

However, it can be executed directly from the Blender GUI, CLI or your operating system command console.

It supports **.mpd**, **.ldr**, and **.dat** file formats.

The LDraw import sub-module is based on [Import LDraw](https://github.com/TobyLobster/ImportLDraw) by Toby Nelson (tobymnelson@gmail.com).
